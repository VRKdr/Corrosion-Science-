        <h1>Corrosion and Its Control</h1>
        
        <h2>What is Corrosion?</h2>
        <p>Corrosion is an irreversible process in which pure metals, except noble metals, are converted into chemically stable compounds like oxides, sulfides, and carbonates. The most common example is the rusting of iron (Fe₂O₃·xH₂O).</p>
        
        <h2>Electrochemical Theory of Corrosion</h2>
        <p>When metals are exposed to air, moisture, and soil, corrosion occurs through electrochemical processes forming anodic and cathodic areas. Corrosion happens at the anode due to oxidation, while reduction occurs at the cathode.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of Corrosion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Galvanic Corrosion:</strong> Occurs when two dissimilar metals are in contact in an electrolyte, causing the more active metal to corrode.</li>
            <li><strong>Uniform Corrosion:</strong> A general attack that thins the entire metal surface uniformly.</li>
            <li><strong>Pitting Corrosion:</strong> A localized attack forming pits or holes in the metal surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Stress Corrosion:</strong> Caused by the combined effect of static tensile stress and a corrosive environment.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Corrosion Prevention</h2>
        <h3>Cathodic Protection</h3>
        <p>Involves making the metal a cathode to prevent corrosion using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sacrificial Anodic Protection:</strong> Using a more active metal like Zn or Mg that corrodes in place of the protected metal.</li>
            <li><strong>Impressed Current Protection:</strong> Applying an external current to counteract corrosion.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Protective Coatings</h3>
        <p>Using paints, varnishes, and enamels to create a barrier against corrosion. These coatings include pigments, drying oils, thinners, driers, and plasticizers.</p>
